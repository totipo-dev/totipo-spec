The [v1/r16 specification](spec/totipo-vault-format-v1.md) is normative. Design
checkpoints in `review/` are historical inputs, and the Go consumer is conformance
evidence rather than production code.

Protocol changes need rationale and corresponding cases. Review exact wire changes,
case IDs, schema changes, and moving-profile pins together. Do not regenerate
expectations merely to make a failing consumer pass. Preserve historical reports
and checkpoints. Pre-RC case IDs may be removed or replaced when their concepts
are removed; document every delta.

Before proposing changes, run:

```sh
gofmt -l conformance
make check
make race
make fuzz
go -C conformance vet ./...
```

Use the preserved Nix environment when available. See [FORMAT.md](vectors/FORMAT.md)
for deliberate fixture maintenance. Every physical case must be manifest-listed
exactly once and required by the moving profile. Abstract graph/storage cases must
state their modeling limits. A synthetic cycle does not claim constructible
cryptographic bytes, and a modeled durability outcome does not prove host crash
behavior.
